# atiart.dk

This project is an art store website and it's content management system.

I utilized some technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Git and AJAX.

Due to utilize AJAX, and SPA design, users have instant access to all parts without refreshing the page.

You can access main page on `index.php` and management page on `management.php` .

`index.php` works like a single page app and that includes home page, shop page, about page, contact page and cart page.

# Manage products

On "manage products" page, admin can see all active and deactive products list and them details, like name, size, price, details, sort and activation.

In addition, admin can add a new product by pushing "Add New Product" button, so a new box will open and He/She can set product items and chose 3 images for product and see image preview without refreshing. Images storage in temp directory, if admin pushes save button, images move to upload directory.

The Sort item sets due to the active products, so if admin chose "deactive" option for the product, it has no sort and will not show for user.

Admin can remove product by pushing "remove product" button (and confirmation), or edit it by pushing "edit product" button. Admin can edit name, size, price, details, sort, activation and change images (or add new image if there was not eny image) , or remove images.
